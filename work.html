                        This site was created for a startup called Emjoyment. The main purpose for this website was to inform people about an app they were creating. The goal was to be simple and informative so that the visitor could quickly understand the function of the app. This was also my first opportunity for creating a mobile site. It was extremely important that this site was mobile friendly since the product was meant to be used as a mobile phone app. I worked on the front end with the HTML and CSS and did some illustrations in Illustrator. </p>

                    At a Hackathon at Cal Poly hosted by Evernote our team came up with a web application that would help students in school. The idea was to create a web application where students could upload and share their class notes using Evernote. Once a student uploads his or her notes, other student would be able to view and vote on the quality of notes. We came up with this idea when thinking of those emergencies when missing class would be inevitable and creating an application where quality notes could be found. For this project I worked on the front end of our site. This was my first time using Bootstraps to create a project. I also used Photoshop and Illustrator to create graphics and illustrations for the site. We never did complete the project to production, but I used it as a very helpful learning experience.

                    This was a class project based on our summer vacation. This was my very first project involving HTML and CSS. I created some galleries using a slider and lightbox. The project was a very fun and challenging, and gave me a good understanding of the basics of web design such as typography, image optimization, and Jquery plugins. The main tools for this project were HTML, CSS, Coda, and Photoshop.
